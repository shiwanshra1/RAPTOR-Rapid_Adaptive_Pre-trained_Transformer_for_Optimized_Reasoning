# LLM Architecture Overview

This section details the key components required for building a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM), using the GPT architecture.

### Key Components:

1. **GPTDatasetV1**:  
   - Prepares data by tokenizing input text and splitting it into chunks for training.
   - Uses a sliding window to create overlapping sequences of a fixed maximum length.
   - Each sequence is paired with its corresponding target sequence (shifted by one token).

2. **MultiHeadAttention**:  
   - Defines the multi-head self-attention mechanism.
   - Focuses on different parts of the input sequence during prediction.
   - Includes:
     - Query, Key, and Value projections (learnable linear transformations).
     - Scaled dot-product attention with a causal mask (prevents future tokens visibility).
     - Final linear projection to combine results from all attention heads.

3. **LayerNorm**:  
   - Implements Layer Normalization to normalize input across the feature dimension.
   - Improves training stability and convergence speed, using learnable parameters for scaling and shifting.

4. **GELU**:  
   - A Gaussian Error Linear Unit (activation function) that introduces non-linearity.
   - Commonly used in transformer models to help the network learn complex patterns.

5. **FeedForward**:  
   - Defines a position-wise feed-forward network with two linear layers and a GELU activation in between.
   - Processes the output from the attention mechanism and introduces non-linearity.

6. **TransformerBlock**:  
   - Implements a single transformer block consisting of:
     - Multi-head self-attention with a residual connection.
     - Feed-forward network with another residual connection.
     - Layer normalization applied before attention and feed-forward layers.

### Key Features:

- The architecture is based on the original transformer design, focusing on the decoder part to generate text sequences.
- **Multi-head attention** enables the model to learn dependencies across tokens.
- **Feed-forward networks** help further process dependencies.
- **Residual connections** prevent vanishing gradients during training.
- **Layer normalization** stabilizes the training process.

By stacking multiple `TransformerBlock`s, the model scales to handle larger tasks and datasets, enabling it to generate contextually relevant text.

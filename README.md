# RAPTOR: Rapid Adaptive Pre-trained Transformer for Optimized Reasoning

**RAPTOR** is a lightweight and efficient large language model (LLM) designed for high-performance natural language processing while minimizing computational overhead. The model aims to provide scalable solutions for various NLP tasks with a focus on adaptability and optimization.

## Sections:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
In this section, we will outline the steps taken for data preprocessing, including:
- Data collection and cleaning
- Tokenization and text normalization
- Removing stopwords and non-relevant information
- Preparing datasets for model input

### 2. **Architecture**
The RAPTOR model is built on a transformer-based architecture, utilizing self-attention mechanisms to process and generate natural language. The architecture is optimized for both efficiency and high performance, making it suitable for a range of NLP tasks.

### 3. **Pretraining**
Pretraining is the phase where RAPTOR is exposed to large amounts of unlabelled data to learn general language patterns. The model will undergo:
- Training on a diverse corpus to understand grammar, context, and relationships in language
- Optimization of the transformer weights using suitable loss functions
- Ensuring that the model is adaptable to various NLP tasks

### 4. **Weight Loading**
Once pretrained, the model weights will be loaded into the architecture for fine-tuning or deployment. In this phase, we:
- Load pretrained weights from checkpoints
- Ensure that the model can be efficiently used for further training or inference

### 5. **Fine Tuning**
Fine-tuning will be applied on specific downstream tasks such as:
- Text classification
- Question answering
- Text generation
This process will involve training on task-specific datasets and adjusting the model parameters for better performance.

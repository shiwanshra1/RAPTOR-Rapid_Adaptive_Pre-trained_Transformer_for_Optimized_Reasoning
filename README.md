# RAPTOR: Rapid Adaptive Pre-trained Transformer for Optimized Reasoning


## Overview
RAPTOR (Rapid Adaptive Pre-trained Transformer for Optimized Reasoning) is a cutting-edge, transformer-based model designed for complex reasoning tasks. It leverages advanced deep learning techniques to achieve superior adaptability, efficiency, and inference speed. RAPTOR is optimized for various natural language processing (NLP) applications, including question-answering, logical reasoning, and structured inference.

## Features
- **Adaptive Learning**: The model dynamically adjusts to different reasoning tasks with minimal fine-tuning.
- **State-of-the-Art Pre-training**: Uses a robust pre-training strategy to enhance performance across multiple domains.
- **High-Speed Inference**: Optimized architecture ensures rapid processing with minimal computational overhead.
- **Modular and Scalable**: Easily integrates into large-scale AI workflows and can be customized for various applications.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the RAPTOR environment:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shiwanshra1/RAPTOR-Rapid_Adaptive_Pre-trained_Transformer_for_Optimized_Reasoning.git
   cd RAPTOR-Rapid_Adaptive_Pre-trained_Transformer_for_Optimized_Reasoning
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv raptor_env
   source raptor_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: raptor_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Data Preparation
Ensure your dataset is placed in the `02_data/` directory. Use the preprocessing scripts available in this directory to prepare the data for model training.

### Model Training
- **Pre-training:** Navigate to `04_pretraining/` and execute the scripts to pre-train the model on a large dataset.
- **Fine-tuning:** Use the scripts in `06_finetuning/` to fine-tune the pre-trained model on task-specific datasets.

### Running Inference
After fine-tuning, load the trained model using the scripts in `05_weightloading/` and use it for reasoning tasks:
```python
from raptor import RAPTORModel

# Initialize model
model = RAPTORModel()

# Perform reasoning
output = model.reason("What is the capital of France?")
print(output)
```

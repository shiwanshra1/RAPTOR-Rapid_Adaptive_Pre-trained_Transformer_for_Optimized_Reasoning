# RAPTOR: Rapid Adaptive Pre-trained Transformer for Optimized Reasoning

## Preface

Welcome to the **RAPTOR** project repository! This repository contains the implementation of **RAPTOR** (Rapid Adaptive Pre-trained Transformer for Optimized Reasoning), an advanced deep learning-based model designed to perform optimized reasoning tasks across various domains.

RAPTOR utilizes cutting-edge techniques in natural language processing and machine learning, incorporating large-scale pre-training methods and fine-tuning strategies for various real-world applications, such as:

- Text generation
- Language translation
- Sentiment analysis
- Text summarization
- Question answering

This project showcases a detailed pipeline for building, training, and evaluating large pre-trained models, with special emphasis on:

- Data preprocessing and handling
- Model architecture definition
- Pre-training and fine-tuning
- Evaluation and performance analysis
- Optimized reasoning capabilities

### Features:
- Efficient data handling pipeline
- Modular and extendable architecture
- Integration with popular NLP tasks
- Support for large-scale pre-trained models
- Scalable fine-tuning strategies
